i am a software developer :D

future functionality:
  - notification system
  - add more features for book verification
  - remember me functionality
  - add comment section for individual public books
  - 

bugs: 
  - bug with theme sticking to its system even after icon interaction (fixed)
  - account display not closing (fixed)
  - books added to discover don't display (learn caching perhaps?) // real-time // caching (fixed)
  - images with same cover can still be uploaded if urls are different (stack overflow - Compare two Images in JavaScript) 

what i want to refactor
  - refactor dashboard UI
  - refactor landing page
  - refactor profile/settings
  - refactor the carousel card to be hover overlay 
    : showing publisher, viewed/read, rating avg (https://youtu.be/o1iSyZ5QjDg)
