i am a software developer :D

future functionality:
  - notification system
  - add more features for book verification
  - remember me functionality
  - add comment section for individual public books
  - add a start prompt that ask for user preference

bugs: 
  - bug with theme sticking to its system even after icon interaction (fixed)
  - account display not closing (fixed)
  - books added to discover don't display (learn caching perhaps?) // real-time // caching (fixed)
  - images with same cover can still be uploaded if urls are different (stack overflow - Compare two Images in JavaScript) 
  - bug where book details component results in carousel dragging (huge bug)

what i want to refactor
  - refactor dashboard UI
  - refactor landing page
  - refactor profile/settings
  - refactor the carousel card to be hover overlay 
    : showing publisher, viewed/read, rating avg (https://youtu.be/o1iSyZ5QjDg)

thinking:
  - what are some things you would want to know when reading a book
    - (rating, genre, reply, views, completion, title, summary)
  - if you were creating visualizations of the book details how would you display theme
    - (pie chart, bar chart, line chart)
  -
